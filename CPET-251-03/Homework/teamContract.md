# Team Contract

As a group, we will

1. Agree to do an equal share of the work, ensuring an understanding of the problems, and communicating when discrepancies arise
2. Notify other team members when they are unavailable, or when questions are incomplete
3. Be open to differing approaches, and listen to new ideas

Meetings will be on Tuesdays from 4-5pm in Gleason 1360, although if necessary it may run longer, as the lab is open until the end of the day. If possible, each individual will have their part of the homework done. The meeting will be to finish homework, if necessary, and discuss issues that we had with said problems. Homework will be turned in by the end of the meeting.
