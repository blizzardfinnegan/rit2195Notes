1.  List reasons why Bluetooth is a popular wireless communication protocol. 
    Small, low cost, low power, widely implemented.

2.  List limitations of Bluetooth.
    Prevalence creates interference amongst nets, its on the same frequency as a lot of proprietary communication standards leading to further interference, short communcation range, and slow transfer rate.

3.  It is possible to communicate via Bluetooth in an adjacent classroom.
    True/==False==[^1]

    [^1]: It is possible, but isn't completely true, as the connection may drop out when using the farthest points of the classrooms

4.  A Bluetooth Piconet can have up to how many active peripherals?

    1.  63
    2.  31
    3.  15
    4.  ==7==

5.  Bluetooth can support simultaneous connections. The devices don't interfere with each other due to:

    1.  ==Spread-spectrum frequency hopping==
    2.  radio shielding in each device
    3.  dedicated frequencies for each stream of data
    4.  none of the above

6.  Bluetooth devices change frequencies

    1.  five times per second
    2.  100 times per second
    3.  ==1600 times per second==
    4.  3200 times per second

7.  You can change the address of a Bluetooth device.
    True/==False==

8.  Which of the following transfer protocols are supported by Bluetooth

    1.  ==AVRCP==
    2.  I2C
    3.  ==GAVDP==
    4.  ==RFCOMM==

9.  Which transfer protocol is used by the Bluetooth module in our lab kit?
    RFCOMM

10.  With your Bluetooth devices in ==discover== mode, other bleutooth devices can find and make contact with you.
