Professor: Holly Dickens
Semester: 2195 (2020 Spring)
Time Slot: MWF 10-11 (10-11am)

Professor Dickens was a wonderful professor. She is very well versed in the topics of the class, and is willing to teach something multiple times if certain students don't understand a topic. She is very passionate about the subject as well, and is happy to give more information than necessary if students are interested in a particular topic.
Being very math/programming inclined, and because the course has prerequisites of similarly based courses, we found that we did very well in this class, with not too much additional effort. Time estimate for work amount unavailable, as this document is being created after taking the class, and an estimate is impossible to make. Tests were fairly straightforward, assuming you understood the material. REFERENCE DIAGRAMS HANDED OUT IN CLASS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS. DO NOT LOSE THEM.
