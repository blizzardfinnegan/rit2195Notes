1. Research some widely used microcontrollers, and compare and contrast their performance. 

After significant research, I was unable to find two microcontrollers with easily comparable performance numbers, such as some form of MIPS.

3. Create an invention using a microcontroller. Describe your invention and the role the microcontroller plays in the invention. 

My invention would be a switch that keeps itself flipped in one direction. It is a box containing a switch, a flap, and an actuator. When the switch is flipped, the flap would open, and the actuator would flip the switch back to its original position. The microcontroller would control the flap and the actuator.
