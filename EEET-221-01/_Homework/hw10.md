    1. Calculate the threshold voltage.
        $$
        V_T=V_{sat}*{R_2\over R_1+R_2}=\pm13V*{100\Omega\over 20.1k\Omega}\\
        V_T=\pm0.0646V

17. Consider the circuit in question 15 with the following modifications:
    $$
    R_1=\cancel{20k\Omega}27k\Omega\\
    R_2=\cancel{100\Omega}68k\Omega

35. A circuit is to be designed to convert a 6V sine wave to square wave oscillating between -13V and 13V. A control is to be provided for possible delay adjustment as follows:

    1. At one extreme setting , the output square wave will be $180^\circ$ out of phase with the sine wave.
    2. At the other extreme, the output wave will undergo its transition at positive and negative peaks of the sine wave. 

    Specify the value of any fixed resistance and the range of any variable resistance used.
