| Is there a standard language?                | “We don’t invent our language, we inherit it from others.” (???) | Young: Conformity is similar to racial discrimination. <br />Anzaldua: conformity is “linguistic terrorism” |          | start here                               |
| Should discourses be allowed to communicate? | trying to be in the wrong Discourse can be devastating       | Young: Code-switching is integral to further education of the masses. |          | come from the above                      |
| Standard language = self-erasure             | We make choices about how we say what we say, what we do and who we are<br />Costumes act as a masking agent | Young: linguistic identity and racial identity can’t be separated <br />Anzaldua: racial and linguistic identity amplifies or kills self-identity. <br />“Until I can take pride in my language, I cannot take pride in myself”. |          | merge the above with this                |
