Academic writers forward or repurpose text in 4 ways:

- illustrating
    - describe/analyze a paper
- extending
- borrowing
- authorizing
    - using a quote to supporting a claim



The lower 3 give you something to think with. Illustrating give you something to think about.

The idea is that you’ve changed the idea of the thing you’re stealing from. By analyzing the text you’re reading, you add your own perspective to it



Forwarding, and writing as a whole, by extension, is like an intellectual blood transfusion
