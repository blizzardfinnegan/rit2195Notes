# Rhetorical Situations and their Constituents

Davie develops his position from 3 authors. He uses The Civil War documentary he mentions as a massive example for his piece. He attempts to review the definition of Rhetorical Situations, and give a better explanation of what that means. Rhetorical situations were originally described as “sets of interacting influences from which rhetoric arises, and which rhetoric in turn influences”. 

He starts with Bitzer, who in 1968 wrote “The Rhetorical Situation”, and says that a rhetorical situation is just the context with which discourse is created. Bitzer says the writer is controlled by three things, Exigence, Audience, and Constraints. They sit outside of these things, and has to respond to them to create discourse. 

Davie then discusses Richard Vatz, who attempts to add on to Bitzer in 1973 by saying that they cannot exist without the writer, the writer creates the situation, rather than simple discovery. 

Consigny then adds in 1974 by saying that the rhetorical situation is partially created by the writer, but they can exist on their own, as the writer needs two things: They need to recognize a rhetorical situation when they see it (receptivity) , and they have to have a way forward to create the discourse  (integrity).

Davie says that if we look at all of these in tandem, a rhetorical situation is a set of related factors whose interraction creates and controls discourse. For Davie to understand what that means, he expands on the four parts of the writing process: the Writer, the Audience, the Constraints, and the Exigence. 

Davie says that Exigence needs a comprehensive analysis, Writers are just as important as the other three, and that any of them can be pluralized.
