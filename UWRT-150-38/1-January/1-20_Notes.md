# Gee’s *Discourse*

How does he define Discourse?

- Language and interraction, both verbal, written, and gestural, the subtle things
- “Singing, doing, and being” combinations

- Who we’re trying to be
    - not just what you say, but everything else around that
- socially accepted ways of communicating with the world, and being within the world
- “identity kit”
    - helps not only you identify yourself, but it allows others to recognize your Discourse

Communication goes beyond language use. 

How does one identify a teacher through their discourse?

- in front of the class
- tools
    - whiteboard
    - marker
    - marker
- (semi-)professional attire

We haven’t even touched language. This is just observationally identifying an individuals‘ Discourse.

- they teach in an educational and informative way

Discourse also holds values. In the teaching example, academic integrity.

Discourses can only be taught, through “apprenticeship” or “enculturation”.



There are 2 types of Discourses. 

- Primary
    - childhood environments
    - primary socialization
    - used to make sense of the world on the whole
    - establishes an enduring sense of self… generally
    - often foundations of other Discourses
- Secondary
    - non-home-based environments
    - social institutions that demand a type of Discourse AND discourse
        - school
        - clubs/hobbies
        - job
    - often accompanied by slang and acronyms
    - Many Discourses within Discourses

“I went to Catholic school for 13 years, then I went to college and took acid and realized that God didn’t exist.” - Yockel

One changes one’s self, depending on the Discourses they are within.

Dominant and nondominant Discourses exist, but we’ll get back to that in a second.

The tools used within the Discourses can also represent the individuals values

Search through the discussion posts, and reply to the thread.

Discourse is the group that you associate with when using language, action, belief, values, etc. discourse, by contrast, is just language in use.
