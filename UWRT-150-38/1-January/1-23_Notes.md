Academic text is about the fact that we all read text differently. There’s nothing wrong with that, its good, but it needs to be recognized. So, we need to identify the parts of the text the we do agree with, AND WE DON’T. Don’t just drop the shit you don’t like.

He doesn’t give a shit about the text. He’s probably memorized the damn thing. Its about use of the texts to establish your own opinions.
