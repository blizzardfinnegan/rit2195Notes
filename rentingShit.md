# First meet question and answers

-   How much are you willing to pay for housing (in the event we look somewhere other than Westbrooke)?
    At worst, I believe I can cover $600 a person. (Mainly relying on financial aid to cover that)

-   When would you want to move into said place? (Meaning, would this be your housing for the summer?)
    I believe I will be coming up in August

-   Are you going on co-op for the 2020-2021 school year? 
    Hoping for a Co-op in spring, also hoping to be in Rochester for it.

-   Are you bringing a car?
    Nope.

-   Are you interested in holding parties at the house?
    No, but I would be interested in having a couple friends over once in a while.

-   Do you prefer unfurnished/furnished?

    Furnished.

-   Anyone allergic to cats?

    Not I.

-   Anyone else bringing a pet?

    Nope.

-   1 shower (who showers at night/in the morning). How do you feel about Westbrooke only having 1.5 bathrooms?
    I aim to shower at night (not late, probably 9-10ish). No objections to 1.5 bath, I've lived in a 1.5 bath before with just as many people

-   Do you plan to cook? How often?
    I plan to cook for occasional breakfasts and most dinners. Planning on eating on campus for lunch.

-   When do you like to go grocery shopping?
    Generally, on the weekend, Saturday preferably.

-   Do you want a TV in the living room?
    I don't believe I would have a use for it. Would be a nice-to-have though.

-   Do you plan to have your significant other over? How often? 
    At the current moment, I have no plans of such. If such plans change, I would probably aim for once every other week at most.

-   How often do you want to have friends over? 
    My current mindset says rarely, if ever. That may change as next semester gets closer.

-   If you have a bike, would you want to store it in the apartment/house (if no backyard is available)? 
    N/A

-   How often do you listen to music on a speaker? 
    Once in a while, but headphones are readily available if necessary.

-   What time do you go to bed?
    Approximately 1-2am

-   Do you feel strongly about taking your shoes off when we get in the house? 
    While I don't feel strongly about taking off my shoes when coming inside, its been a habit for a while.

-   If we need cleaning supplies, or something essential for the house (that is rather expensive), are you willing to split the cost?
    Assuming I have the money for it. (Intending on getting a job over the summer, but unknown at the moment).

-   Will you pay over the summer if we secure the apartment, but no-one is living there? 
    See above. 

-   How often do you do laundry and at what time?
    I tend to do laundry once a week. 

-   How long does it take you to get ready in the morning? 
    In general, takes about a half-hour, although in a rush I can make it in 5-10 minutes
