EEET-222-02
Electronics II Lab
Professor: Richard Cliver
Semester: 2195 (2020 Spring)
Time Slot: Unknown

See EEET-221 for description of professor.
This course is very easy, with most labs having step by step instructions. The professor is extremely willing to give hints as to what to do if you and your lab partner are stuck, and we even managed to confuse him once or twice. Lab reports are very easy, no more than a few lines. Any lab supplies are already owned (should be purchased when taking DC Circuits if in the EET major) or supplied in the lab itself.
