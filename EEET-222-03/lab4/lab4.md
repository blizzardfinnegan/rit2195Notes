|                                  | Typical | Maximum | Measured  |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| Input Offset Voltage, V~io~ (mV) | $1.0$   | $5.0$   | $4.95$    |
| Input Offset Current, I~io~ (nA) | $20$    | $200$   | $4.464$   |
| Input Bias Current I~b~ (nA)     | $80$    | $500$   | $33.4714$ |

The input offset Voltage refers to the voltage difference between the two inputs. The input offset current is the amount of current needed to force the opamps output to zero. The input bias current creates a voltage across an input impedance, reducing the losses from the opamp.
