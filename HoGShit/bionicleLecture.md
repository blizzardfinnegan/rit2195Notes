## An Insight to the Deeper Intricacies of Lore and Worldbuilding

### Part 1

The syllabus is on the myCourses

Certifications:…. uh… who knows



In 2001, Lego launched a new idea. This time, they had a story. Different characters were different sets.

Novels, comics, and movies provided the main bulk of the story telling medium. The line continued for several years, ending in 2010. 



***Bionicle***… its on bionicle

bastardization of “*Bio*logical” and “chro*nicle*”

characters were biomechanical robots fighting for a great cause. Monsters, called “Rahi”, fleshed out the world. Powerful “Kanohi” masks were worn by the main characters, called the “Toa”. 

### World primer

Toa = the good guys

they wear kanohi masks of power and weild various tools and elemental powers. 

6 main elements: fire, water, earth, air, ice, and stone

Toa protect Matoran, who don’t have elemental powers. They can use weapons, but aren’t powerful. Matoran are lead by Turaga, who are retired Toa that still have powers, but not much. Instead of “Great Kanohi Masks” they are “Noble Kanohi Masks”.

Various different enemies including

- Makuta
- Rahi
    - animals
- Bohrok[^1]
- Piraka[^1]
- Barraki
- Dark Hunters
- many others

### Where do we start?

Two ways of looking at the lore

- set release order
    - human time
- chronological order
    - story time



Chronological order… you already have to know how the characters work and the lore



## The Beginning

Everything takes place on Mata Nui. This is on the planet Aqua Magna. 

The Matorans live in regions, called Wahi. They live in villages called Koro. They worship the Great Spirit Mata Nui. 



First major event that holds significance for the story

Makuta posesses Rahi through corrupted Kanohi that he creates to form an army, and begins to wage war against the Matorans. Makuta sends Kraata (also called “Sons of Makuta”) to infect Matorans and cause infighting, results in the Shadow Plague. This results in infighting, and eventually Makuta captures the Turaga.



Here is where our heroes come from. Takua, an Av-Matoran, finds six Toa Stones and brings them to Kini-Nui, the great temple at the center of the island. Six Toa canisters wash up on the shores of the island. This is important because thats how normal human people would buy them. When they’re opened, they fall apart, but put themselves together. 

The Toa Mata were actually in their canisters for so long that their biological form died off. When they got out of the canisters, they had to slowly grow themselves.

The names of the first six were as follows:

- Onua
- Lewa
- Pohatu
- Tahu
- Kopaka
- Gali

## Collect the Shinies, Beat the Boss

The Toa Mata have to collect the Great Kanohi to gain their power to defeat Makuta. They don’t like to work together, but eventually they figure it out.

They then have to collect another 5 masks EACH, and squish them together to make the Great Kanohi. 



Then, they had to venture to Kini-Nui, enter Mangaia, the entrance to Makutas Bat-Cave^TM^. They find a swarm of Manas crabs. The crabs are too powerful to fight on their own. But they learn how to merge three together into Toa Kaita, which defeated the Manas crabs. (These were cool, but didn’t sell well)

They separate back out to their singular forms. Each Toa then has to fight a shadow of themselves. Typical edgy shit. They combine their elemental powers to defeat Makuta.

==This elemental combination is INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT==



But, defeat does not mean kill, so he retreats. This ends the Great War.

## The Bohrok Invasion

Makuta sends a sonic signal to the Bohrok swarms whilist retreating, summoning them. The Bohrok is pure mechanical. The drive comes from the Krana, which links the swarm, and give them a hive mind.  Krana are small, organic creatures that live in the video-game weak spot in the Bohrok. 

The Bohrok’s job is to clean. They destroy everything in their path. The Toa try to fight them off, but fail. Matoran, Turaga, and Toa can become maskless, at which point, the Bohrok can shoot out the Krana, making a face-hugger. This connects them to the swarm, and brainwashes them. 

Bohrok-Va are… a thing. They’re Matoran Bohroks… essentially. They don’t have Krana, but still connect to the hivemind. 



The Toa Mata discover the location of the Queens Cahdok and Gahdok. In this cave, they also find the Exo-Toa armor-suits, and are donned by the Toa. The Toa force the Queens to the center of the room and seal them by combining elemental powers. This was difficult, as when the Queens get closer, they become more power. 

They then accidentally fall into energized protodermis (read as: McGuffin), and they re-emerge as the more powerful Toa Nuva. This gives them stronger masks and stronger armor, allowing them to survive in more varied climats.



### Bohrok 2 : Electri-kal boogaloo

Trapping the Queens sends out a signal to the Bohrok-Kal. Bohrok-Kal are more powerful Bohrok powered by more powerful Krana-Kal. The Bohrok-Kal destroy the Exo-Toa, Tahu attempts but fails to use the Kanohi Vahi. 

The Queens converse with the Toa Nuva, and learn that they weren’t supposed to be woken up yet. Their purpose is real, but it wasn’t their time yet. As such, the Bohrok swarms rebuild the place.



Turaga reveal that Matoran can be rebuilt into stronger forms, and get fun names for their heroism. 

Important ones:

- Takua
- Jaller
- Matoro
- Hewkii
- Nuparu
- Nuhrii
- Hahli
- Vhisola
- Kongu
- Orkahm
- Ahkmou
- Tehutti
- Ehrye



#### Kohlii (Koli)

Matorans like sportsball. They call it Kohlii. It settles disputes between villages, but also celebrates peace. Its a good way to represent the three virtues, given by Mata Nui, given to HIM by the Great Beings

- Unity
- Duty
- Destiny

This will show up a lot, so… remember this.

Each match starts with “Play Well”. (This is a thing for Lego, which is short for Play Well in… some language)



## Search for the 7^th^ Toa

Takua the Chronicler discovers the Kanohi Avohkii, the Mask of Light, implying a seventh Toa of Light.



Makuta unleashes his Kraata again, in powerful Rahkshi suits of armor. They’re trying to prevent the Mask of Light from being created. Meanwhile, Takua and Jaller are sent to find the Toa of Light, which would defeat Makuta. (Makuta wears the Mask of Shadows). 

Takua and Jaller end up at Kini-Nui, and all the Rahkshi and the Toa Nuva start fighting. Jaller saves Takua, but dies in the attempt. Takua then faces his destiny as the Toa of Light, Takanuva. 



## Light vs Shadow

Takanuva starts DESTROYING the Rahkshi, and enters Mangaia (the original death of Makuta) to face off against the Makuta. 

The two then play a lovely little game of Kohlii, but they both fall into a pit of protodermis, and emerge as one. He has elements of both life and shadow. He’s basically the most powerful one of all. He then opens a large door blocking the entrance to Metru Nui, where he then led all the Matoran, then separated back to become Takanuva and Makuta once again. He also brings Jaller back from the dead.



## Metru Nui: The City of Legends

Turaga were once Toa, so… 

The Turaga start revealing shit and apparently Matoran are refugees from Metru Nui to Mata Nui. Instead of Wahi, there’s just Metru regions. Surrounded by seas of protodermis. Big Coliseum in the middle. Matoran work here for the Mata Nui, the Great Spirit. Each Metru has its own big thing. Ko-Metru have the educational center.



## Toa Metru

These were the first matorans living in Metru Nui. 

- Whenua
- Nokama
- Vakama
- Nuju
- Matau
- Onewa

Gathered by Toa Lhikan, a Toa of Fire. He was a part of a different group. 

The Toa Metru had to defeat the Morbuzakh Vines. 



## The Great Cataclysm

Makuta impersonated the Turaga of Metru Nui, Turaga Dume. He tricks Vakama to make the Kanohi Vahi, a Great Mask of Time. Makuta starts sealing off the exits to the city to prevent Matoran from escaping, and organizing Vahki (true robots) squads as a police force.

He kills off the Toa Mangai (Toa Lhikan). Makuta made the Morbuzakh Vines. 

## The Great Disks

There were 6 Great Kanohi Disks exist in Metru Nui, which are used for carving masks.

The Toa Metru used the disks to defeat the king root of the Morbuzakh in the Great Furnace of Ta-Metru.

Vakama later realizes that the disks can be merged to create a Disk of Time. 



Turaga Dume (actually Makuta) declares the Toa Metru as Criminals and orders to have them arrested. The Toa Metru split up to save themselves.  Makuta then hres Dark Hunters Nidhiki and Krekka to destroy the toa as well as the Vahki squads. 



Toa Metru begin loading Matoran spheres into Le-Metru airships to escape Metru Nui, cross the Silver Sea to Mangaia, to settle on Mata Nui.  They had to make two trips for the rest of the Matoran

Makuta did succeed in his plan… a little… and put the Great Spirit Mata Nui into a deep sleep. 



## Visorak Horde

In returning to Metru Nui, the Great city is webs made by the Visorak Rahi. They’re led by from the Island of Stelt, a dude called Sidorak. (Same place as the Dark Hunters) Roodaka, member of the Vortixx species, is an important person. 

The toa get caught, and are mutated by the Visorak Venom, and turn into Toa Hordika. They all get a Rotuka spinner for their power. They meet the Rahaga, six beings who work to protect the Rahi from extinction.



## The Search for the Cure

Vakama has a mind twisted by the venom, and decides to join the Visorak Horde for a bit. Meanwhile, the rest of the Toa Hordika go with the Rahaga to find Keetongu, a rare sentient Rahi with the ability to reverse the effects of the venom. 

Vakama eventually leads the Horde to Keetongu, and a battle ensues. This results in the death of Sidorak, and the disappearance of Visorak. Keetongu reverses the mutations of the Toa Hordika, who then grab the rest of the Matoran Spheres. 

Rahaga stay behind to help the Rahi, and revert to their original forms, the Toa Hagah. Not much is known about them. 



This is the end of the lecture.
