## Homework 7: due 3/2/2020

7. In order to meet an emergency, three single-phase transformers rated at 100kVA, 13.2kV-2.4kV are connected in wye-delta on a 3-phase, 18kV line.
    1. What is the maximum load that can be connected to the transformer bank?
        $$
        100kW=P_\phi\\
        P_{3\phi}\approx173kW
        $$
    
    2. What is the outgoing line voltage?
        $$
        a={N_p\over N_s}={13.2kV\over2.4kV}=5.5\\
        V_s={V_p\over a}={18kV\over5.5}\\
        \overline{\underline{|V_s=3.\overline{27}kV|}}
        $$
8. Two transformers rated at 250kVA, 2.4kV-600V are connected in open-delta to supply a load of 400kVA.
    1. Are the transformers overloaded?
        $$
        I_S={S\over I}={250kVA\over 600V}=416.\overline6A\\
        S=\sqrt3EI=\sqrt3\times416.\overline6A\times600V\\
        S=433.01kVA\\
        \therefore\\
        The\ Transformer\ is\ not\ overloaded
        $$
    
    2. What is the maximum load the bank can carry on a continuous basis?
        $$
        Calculated\ above\ to\ be\\
        S=433.01kVA
        $$
