Given a 200HP 3 phase synchronous motor rated at 460V 60Hz with 8 inductive poles with full load current of 200A with maximum power to rotor (torque angle = 0) calculate the following.

-   What is the synchronous speed of the generator rotor (in RPM)?
    $$
    n_s=120{f\over p}=\cancel{120}30*{\cancel{60}30Hz\over \cancel{8}\cancel{4}1\ poles}\\\overline{\underline{|n_s=900rpm|}}
    $$
    
-   What is the slip?
    $$
    torque\theta = 0\\
    \therefore\\
    s=0
$$
    
-   What is the power factor?
$$
    200HP=149.14kW\\
    S=VI\sqrt3=460V*200A*\sqrt3\\
    S=166.28kVA\\
\overline{\underline{|pf=0.89|}}
    $$
    
-   What is the mechanical output in HP of this motor at full speed?
    $$

-   What is the total impedance of this motor at full load?
    $$
    |Z|={V\over I}={480V\over200A}\\
    <Z=cos^{-1}(0.89)\\
    Z=2.4\Omega <26.24^\circ
    $$

-   What is the resistive impedance of this motor at full load?
    $$
    R=|Z|cos(\theta)=2.4\Omega*0.89\\
    R=2.15\Omega
    $$

-   What is the reactive impedance of this motor at full load?
    $$
    X=|Z|sin(\theta)=2.4\Omega*sin(26.24^\circ)\\
    \overline{\underline{|X=1.06\Omega|}}
    $$

-   What is the full load active power drawn by this motor?
    $$
    200HP=149.14kW
    $$

-   What is the full load reactive power drawn by this motor?
    $$
    Q=\sqrt{S^2-P^2}=\sqrt{166.28kVA^2-149.14kW^2}\\

Apply 3 phase power to the stator.

Define the following terms:

-   Slip of a Synchronous Generator
    The difference in speed (in percent) between the synchronous speed (the frequency of the output signal) and the rotational speed (the speed of the rotor).
-   Armature of a generator
    The rotating portion of the generator. When in a motor, this is the rotor.
-   Rotating AC field generator vs Stationary AC Field Generator
    Rotating AC field generators have stationary magnetic fields, while stationary AC field generators have rotating magnetic fields.
-   Permanent Magnet generator (explain benefits and whether its a stationary or rotating AC field generator)
    Permanent Magnet generators are stationary AC fields. Permanent Magnet generators are cheaper to build.
-   Infinite bus
    The bus who's voltage and frequency remains constant even after variation in the load.
