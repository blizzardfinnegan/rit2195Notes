2. A wye-connected squirrel-cage motor having a synchronous speed of 900r/min has a stator resistance of $0.7\Omega$ and an equivalent rotor resistance of $0.5\Omega$. If the total leakage reactance is $5\Omega$ and the line-to-neutral voltage is 346V, calculate the following:

    1. The value of $Z_1$ and the angle $\alpha$

    2. The speed when the breakdown torque is reached

    3. the current $I_1$ at the breakdown torque (see below)

    4. The value of the breakdown torque [N*m]



4. A 550V, 1780r/min, 3-phase, 60Hz, squirrel cage induction motor running at no-load draws a current of 12A and a total power of 1500W. Calculate the value of $X_m$ and $R_m$ per phase.
