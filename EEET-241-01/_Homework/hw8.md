2. Explain how a revolving field is set up in a 3-phase induction motor.



14. How can we change the direction of rotation of a 3-phase induction motor?



15. 
    1. Calculate the synchronous speed of a 3-phase, 12-pole induction motor that is excited by a 60Hz source.
    2. What is the nominal speed if the slip at full load is 6%?



18. A 3-phase 75hp, 440V induction motor has a full-load efficiency of 91% and a power factor of 83%. Calculate the nominal current per phase.



23. A large, 3-phase, 4kV, 60Hz, squirrel-cage induction motor draws a current of 385A and a total active power of 2344kW when operating at full load. The corresponding speed is accurately measured at 709.2r/min. The stator is connected in wye and the resistance between the two stator terminals is $0.10\Omega$. The total iron losses are 23.4kW and the windage and friction losses are 12kW. Calculate the following:
    1. the power factor at full load
    2. the active power supplied to the rotor
    3. the total $I^2R$ losses in the rotor
    4. The load mechanical power [kW], torque [$kN*m$], and efficiency [%].



28. A 3-phase, 5000hp, 6kV, 60Hz, 12-pole, wound-rotor induction motor turns at 594r/min. What are the approximate rotor $I^2R$ losses at rated load?

29. The motor in the problem above has the following characteristics:

    - DC resistance between stator terminals = $0.112\Omega @17^\circ C$
    - DC resistance between rotor slip-rings = $0.0073\Omega@17^\circ C$
    - open-circuit voltage induced between slip-rings with rotor locked = 1600V
    - line-to-line stator voltage = 6000V
    - no-load stator current, per phase = 100A
    - active power supplied to motor at no-load = 91kW
    - windage and friction losses = 51kW
    - iron losses in the stator = 39kW
    - locked-rotor current at 6000V = 1800A
    - Active power to stator with rotor locked = 2207kW

    Calculate:

    1. Rotor and stator resistance per phase at $75^\circ C$ (assume a wye connection)
    2. Voltage and frequency induced in the rotor when it turns at 200r/min and at 594r/min
    3. Reactive power absorbed by the motor to create the revolving field at no-load
    4. $I^2R$ losses in the stator when the motor runs at no-load (winding temperature $75^\circ C$)
    5. Active power supplied to the rotor at no-load

30. Referring to the motor described in the above problem, calculate under full-voltage LR (locked-rotor) conditions:

    1. Reactive power absorbed by the motor
    2. $I^2R$ losses in the stator
    3. Active power supplied to the rotor
    4. Mechanical power output
    5. Torque developed by the rotor
