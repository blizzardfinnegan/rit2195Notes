1.  Name the principal components of an induction motor.
    
2.  Explain how a revolving field is set up in a 3-phase induction motor.
    
3.   If we double the number of poles on the stator of an induction motor, will its synchronous speed also double?
    
4.   The rotor of an induction should never be locked while full voltage is being applied to the stator. Explain.
    
5.   Why does the rotor of an induction motor turn slower than the revolving field?
    
6.   What happens to the rotor speed and the rotor current when the mechanical load on an induction motor increases?



10.  A 3-phase, 20-pole induction motor is connected to a 600V, 60Hz source.

     2.  If the voltage is reduced to 300V, will the synchronous speed change? 



12.  Calculate the approximate values of the starting current, full-load current, and the no-load current of a 150 horsepower, 575V, 3-phase induction motor.

18. A 3-phase 75hp, 440V induction motor has a full-load efficiency of 91% and a power factor of 83%. Calculate the nominal current per phase.



23. A large, 3-phase, 4kV, 60Hz, squirrel-cage induction motor draws a current of 385A and a total active power of 2344kW when operating at full load. The corresponding speed is accurately measured at 709.2r/min. The stator is connected in wye and the resistance between the two stator terminals is $0.10\Omega$. The total iron losses are 23.4kW and the windage and friction losses are 12kW. Calculate the following:
