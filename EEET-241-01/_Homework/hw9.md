## Homework 9: due 3/25/2020

14. A 300hp, 2.3kV, 3-phase, 60Hz, squirrel-cage induction motor turns at a full-load speed of 590r/min. Calculate the approximate value of rotor $I^2R$ losses. If the line voltage then drops to 1944V, calculate the following:
    1. The new speed, knowing that the load torque remains the same.
    2. The new power output.
    3. The new $I^2R$ losses in the rotor.
