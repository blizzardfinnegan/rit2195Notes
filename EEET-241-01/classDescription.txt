Professor: Richard Garrett
Semester: 2195 (2020 Spring)
Timeslot: Unknown

Professor Garrett is one of, if not THE, worst professor we have ever had the displeasure of having. If a student has a question, he rarely if ever answers it successfully. He has decent humor, and uses it regularly. He is very knowledgable in the course, but expects everyone to catch on in the first try. He is not much a fan of reiterating his points.
The class itself uses fairly simple concepts learned in AC and DC circuits. If you did well there, you will do well here. All homeworks are direct from the book, and most exams, if not all of them, are based on the quizzes and previous tests.
