# Review

Lets assume we found a house on an asland and we checked the voltage in an outlet and found the following.
$$
E_m=2V
\\
I_m=1.5A
\\
f=60Hz
\\
\theta = {\pi \over 3}rad
$$
What is the period?

$1 \over 60$ seconds, or $0.1 \overline{66}$ seconds.



Conversion from cos to sin

cos -> sin 

+90^o^

sin -> cos

-90^o^



## Effective Value (RMS)

$V_{eff}=V_{RMS}=E_m* {\sqrt{2}\over 2}= E_m*0.707$



We will be working with RMS values in this class. If you ever need to work with max values, you will need to calculate it. But weâ€™ll probably just work with RMS in general.



## Phasor shit

Usually used for voltage (and occasionally power)

$120<20 ^{\circ}$

### Leading vs lagging

Everything is a voltage source. The current is a result. Thus, if it is leading, the current is ahead of the voltage. If it is lagging, the current is behind the voltage.



3 phase means 3 voltage sources $120^{\circ}$ apart. This is a fixed constant. This means that all the loads should be the same values.



If the current relative to the voltage is a capacitive current, it leads by $90^{\circ}$. Inductive lags by the same

***Inductive circuits lag. Capacitive circuits lead.***

## Harmonics

Fundamental harmonic is the frequency of the system.

each harmonic is x times the fundamental frequency.

## Impedance

$Z=R-j(2\pi fL<90^{\circ}-{1\over 2\pi fC}<(-90^{\circ}))$ or in phasor form

Cap leads by $90^{\circ}$

inductor lags by $90^{\circ}$

## Right hand rule

$$
E=N{\Delta \phi \over \Delta t}
\\
where\\
E=Voltage\\
N=turns\\
\Delta\phi=\Delta flux (webers)\\
\Delta t=\Delta time
$$

## Examples

### Example 1

$V(t)=12cos(60t+45^{\circ})$

phasor $\ne 12<45^{\circ}$

phasor = $6\sqrt{2}<45^{\circ}$



# Chapter 7

Power and wattage are the same. Positive watts is power in, negative watts is power out. 

True power is a little more difficult.

$P=IV(cos(\theta_V-\theta_I))$

Circulating power, or reactive power is measured in voltamps reactive (VAR)

$Q=VI(sin(\theta_V-\theta_I))$

Complex power is the total power, measured in voltamps (VA)

$S=|V||I|$

Ratio of active power to apparent power is the power factor.

$pf={P\over S}=cos(\theta_V-\theta_I)$

$745.7W =1hp$
