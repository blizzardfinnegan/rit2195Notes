Good sense of humor, or so it appears. Nice and talkative.

Adjunct professor, so won’t always be here

Fits like Cliver fairly well, likes to get on a little bit of a tangent.

Knows a bit about legal-ese

“Bring you a flavor of reality. What you’re really gonna run across with transformers, motors, and generators. I will use the book as a basis. I will cover some things not in the book, but they will be used extensively in the industry.”

We’ll talk about some things that are skimmed in the book, but the professor believes to be important.

You should know enough jargon to understand whats going on, and you’ll know what questions you need to ask to understand.

Should be an active classroom, he doesn’t want yes-men and bobble-heads.

If you can understand the homework, you can understand the class.

The exams can have a 1-page cheat sheet, both sides. Don’t memorize, understand principles. Those who are naught but function repeaters will not do well in this class.

Lecture is not all-encompassing. They are mainly talking points. If you can’t find them… he’s not extremely technologically literate.

2 exams: 60%

Homework: 10% completion grade

final: 30%

***If you have a 90% exam average, you’re exempt from the final***

Fun Fact: Licensing for Professional Engineer is $450 per state every 3 years

Most in class examples are from his wastewater processing. Will also talk about receiving from utilities.



There’s crossover from AC circuits.

Most motors are induction motors. Most generators are synchronous generators.

DC motors are making a comeback, because computers.

Gonna skim over power systems, sprinkle it out through the semester.



# Actual Notes

We will use conventional current flow. Please.

Current goes from + (source) to + (load). Thats great for DC, but what about AC?

We use + and - to talk about conventional current at a 0^o^ for + and - for 180^o^.

Remember phasor diagrams? God I hope so.



We are not going to talk about a combined AC/DC sources. We can do that, but we won’t deal with it because that just makes things needlessly complex. Everything is symmetric around zero.



e/E and v/V both mean voltage. Don’t worry about it.

e/v/i is instantaneous. E~m~/V~m~/I~m~ is peak

$cos(2\pi ft+ \theta)$ is our standard for both current and voltage. $\theta$ is in radians.

Frequency in our walls is 60Hz. Thus, most of our problems will be in 60Hz.
